# Internet Access Management System

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Tech Stack Overview
- **Frontend**: Vue.js or React
- **Backend Language**: Golang
- **API Gateway**: RESTful
- **Inter-Service Communication**: gRPC
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe (mocked)

## 🔧 Microservices Architecture

### Services Breakdown

1. **API Gateway**
   - RESTful endpoint management
   - Request routing
   - Authentication middleware
   - Rate limiting
   - Request/response transformation

2. **Authentication Service**
   - User registration
   - Login/logout mechanisms
   - JWT token management
   - Role-based access control
   - Password reset functionality

3. **Services Service**
   - Resource provisioning management
   - SSH connection enablement
   - FTP resource allocation
   - Service activation/deactivation
   - Resource usage tracking

4. **Payment Service**
   - Stripe payment integration (mocked)
   - Transaction processing
   - Subscription management
   - Invoice generation
   - Payment status tracking

5. **Communication Service**
   - gRPC-based inter-service communication
   - Service discovery
   - Load balancing
   - Health checking

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Authentication Flow
```
User Request -> API Gateway -> Auth Service -> Token Validation 
-> Service Authorization -> Resource Access
```

### gRPC Communication Security
- Mutual TLS authentication
- JWT token validation
- Encrypted channel
- Interceptors for logging and monitoring

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Containerization
- Docker for service containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Helm charts for deployment
- Separate environments (dev/staging/prod)

## 📡 Communication Protocol

### gRPC Inter-Service Communication
- Protocol Buffers for service definitions
- Lightweight and efficient communication
- Strong typing
- Language-agnostic service contracts

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/internet-access-system.git

# Initialize services
make init

# Run services
make dev

# Run tests
make test
```

## 🛠️ Service Configurations

### Authentication Service
- JWT token generation
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Services Service
- Resource allocation engine
- Compliance checks
- Usage metering

### Payment Service
- Stripe mock integration
- Webhook handling
- Recurring billing support

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus for metrics
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- ELK stack for logging
- Grafana dashboards

## 🔍 Future Roadmap
- Serverless function integration
- Machine learning usage prediction
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-cloud support
